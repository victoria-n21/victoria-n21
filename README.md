- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @victoria-n21
I'm using Github to upload personal projects and practice documentation. Most of these projects will be Arduino-based (Arduino Mega2560 board), although I will also be
uploading schematics for any analog-only circuits. I'll also upload any pure-software projects that I come up with as a way to practice programming. For each of these projects
I will do my best to document them so that they're easy to follow, so please let me know if you had a good/bad experience trying any of these projects. 

For background, I have a BSEE and am currently working on a Master's in Engineering Management. This is a way for me to keep my skillset up-to-date and further my interest in 
the EE world. Thanks for reading!
